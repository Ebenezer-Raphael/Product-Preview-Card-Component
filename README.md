## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I learned how to make the design responsive using Flexbox.

css:
```css
@media screen and (max-width: 700px) {
    .flex-container {
        display: flex;
        flex-direction: column;
        width: 343px;
    }
}
```

### Useful resources

- [HTML & CSS: Design and Build Web Sites - Book by Jon Duckett](https://www.htmlandcssbook.com/) - This helped me address minor issues in my code. And I will continue using it.
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This is where I learned how to make the web page responsive.
